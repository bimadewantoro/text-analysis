# Text Analysis

## Introduction

This is a simple text analysis application written in Python. It allows users to:

- Load text from a file or input manually
- Search for a word and count its occurrences
- Replace a word with another word
- Sort words alphabetically

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bimadewantoro/text-analysis.git
   cd text-analysis
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. If you want to analyze a text file, pass the file path as an argument:

   ```bash
   python main.py -f path/to/your/textfile.txt
   ```

2. If you want to input text manually, just run the script without any arguments:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to search for a word, replace a word, or sort words alphabetically.

## Example

To analyze a text file named `sample.txt`:

```bash
python main.py -f sample.txt
```
